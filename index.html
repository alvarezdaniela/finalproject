    <h1>FINAL PROJECT</h1>
    <p>Created Glitch Art background image from my image of the "Lodestar"
      created by Randy Polumbo. I took the image at the Coachella Festival in April.
      My image was captured during the day which is why the colors come from
      erasing several lines of code.
