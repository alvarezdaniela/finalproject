    <h1>FINAL PROJECT</h1>
    <p>Created Glitch Art background image from my image of the "PALM-3 WORLD STATION"
      created by Sim√≥n Vega. I took the image at the Coachella Festival in April.
      My image was captured at night which gave the original image a blue tone. Yet, when
      erasing several code the end result was this.
