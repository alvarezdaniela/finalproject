    <h1>FINAL PROJECT</h1>
    <p>Created Glitch Art background image from my image of the "Etherea"
      created by Edoardo Tresoldi. I took the image at the Coachella Festival in April.
      My image was captured at night which is why the colors are of darker decent. Yet, when
      erasing several code the end result was this.
