    <h1>FINAL PROJECT</h1>
    <p>Created Glitch Art background image from my image of the "Supernova"
      created by Roberto Behar and Rosario Marquardt. I took the image at the Coachella Festival in April.
      My image was captured during the night yet the installation is so colorful that, that I was able to
      abstract the colors by erasing several pieces of code.
